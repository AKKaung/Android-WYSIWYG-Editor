Features
-------------

The editor is built, so that every part of the design have been exposed and is available for customization. You can define, how the editor should look like, and what are the controls, that should be available (the controls toolbar layout can also be created by yourself, just call the API methods on the click event).

**Available Controls:**

| Control     | Usage |
| :------- | ----: |
| H1,  H2 and H3 | Insert Headings | 
| Bold, Italic, Underline & Overline    | Used to style the text   | 
| Image Picker| Insert Images to the editor from storage or a URL    | 
| Hyperlinks | Add Links to the editor
|Google Maps locations | Use the embedded mapp editor to tag and insert locations to the editor |
|Numbered and Bulleted Lists | Enough said |
|Line Divider | Add a divider among paragraphs or Headings
| | |



Usage
-------------------

**content_editor_test.xml:**

                   <LinearLayout
                        android:layout_width="match_parent"
                        android:id="@+id/formHolder"
                        android:layout_marginBottom="20dp"
                        android:orientation="vertical"
                        android:layout_height="wrap_content">
                    </LinearLayout>

**EditorTestActivity.java:**


	 

     @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
         {
                super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
                setContentView(R.layout.activity_editor_test);
                LinearLayout _LinearLayout= (LinearLayout)findViewById(R.id.formHolder);
                _editor =new Editor(EditorTestActivity.this,_LinearLayout,  RenderType.Editor, "Start typing...");
              _editor.startEditor();
        }
        
    
        

If you are using **Image Pickers** or **Map Marker Pickers**, Add the following too in **LayoutActivity.java**:

    
     @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {

        if (requestCode == _editor.PICK_IMAGE_REQUEST && resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK&& data != null && data.getData() != null) {

            Uri uri = data.getData();

            try {
                Bitmap bitmap = MediaStore.Images.Media.getBitmap(getContentResolver(), uri);
                // Log.d(TAG, String.valueOf(bitmap));
                _editor.InsertImage(bitmap);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), e.getMessage(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        else if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_CANCELED) {
            //Write your code if there's no result
            Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), "It was canccelled", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            _editor.RestoreState();
        }
        else if(requestCode== _editor.MAP_MARKER_REQUEST){
            _editor.InsertMap(data.getStringExtra("cords"), true);
        }
    }

> **Note:**

> - You must define the **Toolbar by yourself**, or you can use the  **Embedded Toolbar** inside the library.

###Open a document

You can open a document from <i class="icon-provider-gdrive"></i> **Google Drive** or the <i class="icon-provider-dropbox"></i> **Dropbox** by opening the <i class="icon-refresh"></i> **Synchronize** sub-menu and by clicking **Open from...**. Once opened, any modification in your document will be automatically synchronized with the file in your **Google Drive** / **Dropbox** account.

###Save a document

You can save any document by opening the <i class="icon-refresh"></i> **Synchronize** sub-menu and by clicking **Save on...**. Even if your document is already synchronized with **Google Drive** or **Dropbox**, you can export it to a another location. StackEdit can synchronize one document with multiple locations and accounts.

### Synchronize a document

Once your document is linked to a <i class="icon-provider-gdrive"></i> **Google Drive** or a <i class="icon-provider-dropbox"></i> **Dropbox** file, StackEdit will periodically (every 3 minutes) synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be detected.

If you just have modified your document and you want to force the synchronization, click the <i class="icon-refresh"></i> button in the navigation bar.

> **Note:** The <i class="icon-refresh"></i> button is disabled when you have no document to synchronize.

#### <i class="icon-refresh"></i> Manage document synchronization

Since one document can be synchronized with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking <i class="icon-refresh"></i> **Manage synchronization** in the <i class="icon-refresh"></i> **Synchronize** sub-menu. This will let you remove synchronization locations that are associated to your document.

> **Note:** If you delete the file from **Google Drive** or from **Dropbox**, the document will no longer be synchronized with that location.

----------


Publication
-------------

Once you are happy with your document, you can publish it on different websites directly from StackEdit. As for now, StackEdit can publish on **Blogger**, **Dropbox**, **Gist**, **GitHub**, **Google Drive**, **Tumblr**, **WordPress** and on any SSH server.

###Publish a document

You can publish your document by opening the <i class="icon-upload"></i> **Publish** sub-menu and by choosing a website. In the dialog box, you can choose the publication format:

- Markdown, to publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (**GitHub** for instance),
- HTML, to publish the document converted into HTML (on a blog for example),
- Template, to have a full control of the output.

> **Note:** The default template is a simple webpage wrapping your document in HTML format. You can customize it in the **Advanced** tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

###Update a publication

After publishing, StackEdit will keep your document linked to that publication which makes it easy for you to update it. Once you have modified your document and you want to update your publication, click on the <i class="icon-upload"></i> button in the navigation bar.

> **Note:** The <i class="icon-upload"></i> button is disabled when your document has not been published yet.

###Manage document publication

Since one document can be published on multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking <i class="icon-upload"></i> **Manage publication** in the <i class="icon-provider-stackedit"></i> menu panel. This will let you remove publication locations that are associated to your document.

> **Note:** If the file has been removed from the website or the blog, the document will no longer be published on that location.

----------


Markdown Extra
--------------------

StackEdit supports **Markdown Extra**, which extends **Markdown** syntax with some nice features.

> **Tip:** You can disable any **Markdown Extra** feature in the **Extensions** tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

> **Note:** You can find more information about **Markdown** syntax [here][2] and **Markdown Extra** extension [here][3].


### Tables

**Markdown Extra** has a special syntax for tables:

Item     | Value
-------- | ---
Computer | $1600
Phone    | $12
Pipe     | $1

You can specify column alignment with one or two colons:

| Item     | Value | Qty   |
| :------- | ----: | :---: |
| Computer | $1600 |  5    |
| Phone    | $12   |  12   |
| Pipe     | $1    |  234  |


### Definition Lists

**Markdown Extra** has a special syntax for definition lists too:

Term 1
Term 2
:   Definition A
:   Definition B

Term 3

:   Definition C

:   Definition D

	> part of definition D


### Fenced code blocks

GitHub's fenced code blocks are also supported with **Highlight.js** syntax highlighting:

```
// Foo
var bar = 0;
```

> **Tip:** To use **Prettify** instead of **Highlight.js**, just configure the **Markdown Extra** extension in the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

> **Note:** You can find more information:

> - about **Prettify** syntax highlighting [here][5],
> - about **Highlight.js** syntax highlighting [here][6].


### Footnotes

You can create footnotes like this[^footnote].

  [^footnote]: Here is the *text* of the **footnote**.


### SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                  | ASCII                        | HTML              |
 ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------
| Single backticks | `'Isn't this fun?'`            | 'Isn't this fun?' |
| Quotes           | `"Isn't this fun?"`            | "Isn't this fun?" |
| Dashes           | `-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash` | -- is en-dash, --- is em-dash |


### Table of contents

You can insert a table of contents using the marker `[TOC]`:
